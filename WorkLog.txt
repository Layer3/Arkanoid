    20:00-21:00
        Setting up basic project with SDL2 and compiling a hello world
        Rough Brainstorming for the scope:            
            Menu:
                - Play/Resume
                - Options
                    - Sound Volume (SFX/Music(?))
                    - (Window Size)
                - HighScore 
                - Quit

            Game:
                - Objects for Player, Tiles and Projectiles (counting the bouncy ball as a projectile aswell for now)
                - Rendering the playing field on screen
                    [STRETCHGOAL] Sprites
            
            Audio:
                - Write custom audio solution based on PortAudio. 
                    Basically just a positional Mixer that reads the right SFX from Disk, applies effects and mixes it into the output stream.
                    Could be fed by a command queue and thus be running on a different thread at its own framerate.
                - implement some very basic effects
                    - Filter
                    - BitCrusher
                    - [STRETCHGOAL] more effects
            
            Brainstorm Corner:
                - Slow motion power-up as both a gameplay- and audio-feature (Resampling)
                - Player can charge a shot, but will either move very slowly while doing so or having to stand still. 

Goals for tomorrow:
    - Menu
    - Keyboard controls
    - Basic pong-like setup, where the player can bounce a ball around. Squares and Circles for now.
    - Lives + fail state

        Playing around with the SDL Rendering.
        Ordering thoughts and stripping down first goals into achievable steps.
        Looking into Pixelart and drawing a prototype for the player, background and basic tiles.
    13:00 -14:30
        Break
    14:30
        Basic playing field with tiles and moveable player are working. [Prototype]
    18:00
        Player movement is a lot smoother now, would work in a pinch.
        Refactored classes and constexprs to seperate game and menu contexts more and cleaned up a little.

Implemented
    - Keyboard controls
    - Playing field
    - Tiles
    - Player
    - Basic Render-/Update- & Input-Routines for the game loop

Goals for tomorrow:
    - Playable basic Game loop.
        - Projectiles
        - Collisions
    Maybe setting up the Audio Mixer after the Gameplay loop is implemented. 

19.07
    9:30
        working on projectile rendering and player detachment.
    10:00
        projectile movement
    12:00
        projectiles move and collide with walls and player and get destroyed when colliding with bottomBorder
    13:00-14:00
        Break
    14:30
        Projectiles can destroy tiles, but there are edge cases, especially when hitting tiles from the top
    16:00
        Collisions feel better now, this should work well enough, so further improvements are a [STRETCHGOAL]
    19:00
        basic audio manager works and can mix stereo and surround with limitations.
        also added attenuation so far.
        needs a small message system to request thread safe changes on playing voices.
    19:00-20:00
        Break
    21:00
        panning works fine now locally. Will have to test this on a different machine without interface though [TODO]
        implemented level music and collision/ destruction sounds
        player also has lives now and the game gets soft reset until player is out of lives.

Goals for next time:
    - UI
    - Highscore and fail states
    - Main Menu
    - Time-slow power up
        - Filter
        - BitCrusher

24.07
    20:30-23:00
        Refactoring the updates and gamestates and preparing basic menu.
        Cleaning up memory.
